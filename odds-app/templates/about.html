        <h4>Key Features</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong><a href="/movies-odds">Movie Odds</a>:</strong> A page that compares betting odds to GoldDerby’s own odds (calculated using an unclear methodology). 
                This provides an interesting view of how betting markets diverge from GoldDerby’s predictions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><a href="/win_votes_table">Betting Odds vs. All Star 24 Users</a>:</strong> A page that compares betting odds with the percentage of votes received by each movie
                from GoldDerby’s All Star 24 Users. This feature can be particularly useful, as it leverages predictions from a group of individuals 
                with a proven track record of accurately forecasting awards outcomes.
